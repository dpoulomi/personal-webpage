                I am a jolly, fun loving person who is also a mom for a 2 year old baby boy. I love helping people even if it sometimes 
                causes me little inconvenience. I love exploring new places and food and also I am a nature loving person.
                I have been in the software industry for more than 5 years now and worked for more than 3 years in USA. I love reading books
                specially thriller and motivational novels. I learnt gymnastics and sometimes practise one or two moves at home. I play badminton
                and also love swimming.
