                I am a jolly, fun loving person who is also a mom for a 2 year old baby boy. I love helping people even if it sometimes 
                causes me little inconvenience. I love exploring new places and food and also I am a nature loving person.
                I have been in the software industry for more than 5 years now and worked for more than 3 years in USA. 
                5+ years of experience in Software Engineering, offering an array of development/leadership skills under a steep 
                learning curve. Expertly managed designs, analysis and implementation work, have a thorough knowledge of analytical and complex problem-solving skills. Successfully adapt in a continually evolving en-vironment and thrive in a timeline-driven workplace. Deliver clear/concise communication. I love reading books
                specially thriller and motivational novels. 
                I learnt gymnastics and sometimes practise one or two moves at home. I play badminton
                and also love swimming.
